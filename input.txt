Once upon a time in a faraway land, there lived a wise old owl.
The owl spent its days reading books and watching the world from a tall tree.
People from nearby villages would come to seek its advice.
One day, a young girl named Sanjana climbed the tree to ask about her dreams.
The owl smiled and said, "Follow your heart and stay curious."

In a small town, a boy named Ravi found a magical stone in his backyard.
The stone glowed whenever Ravi felt happy.
Soon, he discovered that the stone could grant wishes, but only selfless ones.
Ravi used it to help others in his town, and his heart grew lighter every day.

The wind whispered stories through the trees, and the stars blinked in approval.
The world was full of mysteries, and only the brave dared to explore them.
